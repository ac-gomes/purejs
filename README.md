# My first JavaScript project

This small project it is only a way to demonstrate to my self if iâ€™m leaning Javascrip as well as I imagine ðŸ˜Š.

Since when I started studies javascript I have been curious how to know each functionality implemented in this small project works behind the scenes using only Vanilla JS, and this is what motivated me to do this simple web page.

To access the data source that I used, [click here](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) it is a fake API.

To see my code running click on this link: [https://ac-gomes.github.io/purejs/](https://ac-gomes.github.io/purejs/)

This is not a responsive page, I haven't learned CSS very well yet.
