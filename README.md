# My first JavaScript project

This simple project is a way to demonstrate to myself taht Iâ€™m leaning Javascrip as well as I imagine ðŸ˜Š.

Since I started to study javascript, I have been curious to know each functionality implemented in this project and to see how it works behind the scenes using only Vanilla JS. this is what motivated me to make this web page.
